Main Projects:
	1.	Classes Between Line Graphs and Claw-free Graphs
	⁃	Abstract:
	⁃	A line graph L(G) of G = (V, E) is the graph with vertex set E in which x, y of E are adjacent as vertices if and only if they are adjacent as edges in G. In 1970, Beineke (and Robertson independently) discovered a forbidden induced subgraph characterization for the class of line graphs of simple graphs. Bermond and Meyer in 1973 generalized this characterization to the class of line graphs of multigraphs, denoted L. One such obstruction of these classes is K_{1,3}, the claw. In 2008, Chudnovsky and Seymour fully characterized the set of claw-free graphs. In this talk, we present explicit and constructive characterizations of several classes between L and claw-free graphs. These constructions aim to provide an alternative approach, with fewer graph classes and operations, to that of Chudnovsky and Seymour. This talk is based on joint work with Guoli Ding.
	⁃	Code Comments:
	⁃	Due to the nature of graph decomposition/construction, we have developed a series of functions/algorithms to test our class conjectures. These allow us to computationally generate graphs, identify properties about them, and make provide insights that would be otherwise difficult by hand.

	⁃	WORK IN PROGRESS: Note that the functions listed are a fraction of those that have been written; the rest will be added once the project’s research has concluded/the final dissertation is being written.

	2.	Social Choice Theory: An Application on Voters of the Associated Press (AP) Top 25 NCAA Football Rankings
	⁃	Problem Description:
	⁃	Division 1 College Football is a major part of American culture, one that everyone can get excited for. Rivalries and competition aside, the NCAA financial landscape has dramatically changed over the past decade with the growth of NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) and online sports betting. Ultimately, this draws more people to the sport. It induces, with even greater severity, the outcomes of these competitive games. 
	⁃	One could pose the simple problem: Based on the results of game play over the regulation season, which teams are worthy to continue to play in the post-season? Every fan has an opinion on this topic; however, the standard polls ranking the top NCAA teams throughout the season could be considered as representative of national consensus. This clearly is contested and gives rise for why one should study the dynamics of such polls. In addition, the separate polls for the top teams may have discrepancies, and this leads to the question of, "Who actually got the ranking right?"
	⁃	Our goal is to look at the NCAA Associated Press (AP) Top 25 poll and see if we can determine group dynamics that may speak to how the group decision, ultimately deciding which teams make the playoffs and those that do not, may be affected.
	⁃	Code Comments:
	⁃	I would like to thank avid sports fan and analytics hobbyist @bakonydraco on Reddit for sharing his NCAA AP Top 25 Football Poll data collection with us.
	⁃	The functions and code listed includes all data cleaning steps with some algorithms. The algorithms determine what “agreement” is defined as and is interpreted into representable graphs. These graphs are printed and can be analyzed for dynamics, the aim of this paper.

	⁃	WORK IN PROGRESS: Note that the functions listed are a fraction of those that have been written; the rest will be added once the project’s research has concluded/the final MS project is being written.

Small Projects:

	1.	CSC_Seminar_Lean__Paper 
	⁃	This paper was prepared for an end of semester project for LSU’s CSC 7800, Computer Science Research Seminar. This was completed in Fall 2023. The project/paper requirements are listed below.

	⁃	Objectives
	⁃	The objective of this assignment is to practice the writing skills learned in this course to prepare a typical technical paper in computer science.

	⁃	Description
	⁃	In this assignment, you are required to submit a short paper of 3 pages. The paper can be literature survey, solution, measurement, or on any technical topics in Computer Science. The paper should be 100% original work done by yourself. Materials used for other courses should NOT be used for this assignment. You are required to use LaTeX and Overleaf to develop the paper. Paper written in Microsoft Word will NOT be accepted. By the due date, you need to submit (1) the PDF file and (2) the LaTeX package (the Zip file downloaded from Overleaf) on Moodle by the due date.
